### What will Travel Dreams do in its MVP üöÄ

- It will have an initial view with the default list of trips received from the endpoint,
  including trip titles, details, and the thumbnail of the trip.
- We will be able to filter by any text found on the cards, both by details and by title
  or description.
- You will be able to select one of the cards, and it will show the details of the
  same, with all the information about the trip, including the itinerary and the large
  image of the trip. This should happen for both upcoming and previously
  completed trips.
- From the initial view, you should be able to delete the trip and edit it.
- You should be able to mark a trip as completed from the detailed view of the trip.
- Bidirectional navigation between completed trips and those yet to be completed
  should be possible.
- There will be a view where we can find the trips that you already completed in the
  past, possibly similar to the view of upcoming trips.
- In this view, you will also be able to set a trip as upcoming, in case you want to
  repeat it. You never know üôÇ.
- The application should work inside a browser on any device.
